Base in my result I can help the group 
Based on my personal results, I am a person with responsibility who likes to do a job well done,

My Ideal Job is: Server Administrator, or admin; has the overall control of a server. This is usually in the context
of a business organization, where a server administrator oversees the performance and condition of 
multiple servers in the business organization.

In the site https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/stem/ I did an investigation and saw that my ideal job 
in the 4th position, with the following data( Network / Systems Admin	32,682	62%	38%) 
but I see the first position occupies it (Computer Support Specialist	121,426	34%	66%) what has left me thinking
because before that I dedicated myself when I worked for the Government of El Salvador.
