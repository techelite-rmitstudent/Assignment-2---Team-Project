1. What went well
The level of organization of my colleagues, helped to complete the required tasks. 
The communication was key, to solve our doubts, canvas was used to carry the sequence and other tools.

2. What could be improved

In my case Canvas should improve because at times I lost myself in the publications, without taking the order of my tasks,
I know that it has been difficult in my case, for labor issues and language.

3. At least one thing that was surprising

What seemed to me the most was the level of help that my companions gave to the moments of meeting with doubts.

4. At least one ting that you have learned about groups


I know that it is hard to work in a group, starting with finding the time when we are all free, the group managed well 
and the objectives were achieved

Thanks to the all the group members
