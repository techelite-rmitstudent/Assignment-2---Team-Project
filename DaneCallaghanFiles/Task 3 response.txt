Hi Guys,

I think Rav will be great to oversee this task too. Thanks to Rav for volunteering for it too.

I think the dimension template looks great too, so I am happy with that.

I'll be attacking all of the GitHub stuff (tuts, linking my page, uploading my files etc) tonight and over the weekend. I think it will be good once we have the team meeting so we can all be on the same page with how we want files on the group repository.

Thanks,

Dane.
