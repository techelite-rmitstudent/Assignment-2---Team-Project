My Ideal Job: Software Engineer - Because it has the highest rate for job posting available today and also the highest rate of 		      pay for jobs in this industry. It may also lead me to be part of the team who are changing the world into a better 	       place (Innovation Technology). 

Comments: Seems the group members have different types of ideal jobs in various departments of Information Technology. When you put them all together, it becomes a strong team of IT professionals with knowledge in all aspects of a company that can build software and technology. "TechElites" is really good fit for the name for this group.

Big 5 Personality Test: Openness to experience -65
			Conscientiousness - 96
			Extroversion - 83
			Agreeableness - 16
		    	Natural reactions - 22
						
How These Results May Influence My Behaviour In A Team:
	I think I would work well in a team, and would expect we had a solid plan where everyone knows exactly what is expected 	from them. I would want a clear timeline established, with defined tasks set out to be completed in that time. I have 		sometimes been described as "too picky" as I can scrutinise every detail. The positive side to that is that I am very 		thorough if assigned a research task.

Things to consider when I form a team: 
	I think personality certainly plays a part in forming a team, and that it can be beneficial to have a mix of different 		types. It is important to know everyone's skills, learning methods and how they work best. If we can understand the 		various types of personalities, we can understand how best to interact with each type.

"Vision message" <!-- Not sure if each member wants to do this themselves, or if we will use something from their persoanl profile-->

Ideal Job: I have recently moved into the financial planning industry. Currently my ideal job is to be a financial adviser, 		   with the hope of one day moving into a management or mentor type role. A Senior Financial Adviser works with clients 	   to help them understand their financial needs. They discuss and assesss various aspects of the client's financial 		   situation such as budgets and cash flow, superannuation, investments, risk management, estate planning and retirement 	    goals. The adviser will help educate the client on these topics and address any concerns they may have.

Comments: Apart from the position of Senior Financial Planner, the jobs listed above have similar requirements as shown below:

- Common Education: All jobs require a degree, and share the Bachelor of IT as a common requirement. Other specialty 		courses are applicable to each job too, such as extra certification.

- Common Skills: Communication, Programming, Analytical, Knowlegde of IT systems

- Salary: The all have similar ranges of salary that will vary depending on experience and role within that discipline.

- Differences: The obvious outlier is Financial Planning as it's a completely different industry. Each of the other jobs will require specialist knowledge that will be unique to that position. A Network Engineer is likely to have a deeper understanding of network structure compared to a software engineer who will specialise in building software. The IT consultant will have a broad but limited overall knowledge of both.

<h1>Damian Gaffey</h1>

<a href="https://damian-gaffey.github.io/Myprofile/">GitHub Profile</a>

Personality Test Results:

Personality Type: Defender - For me personally, I think this sums me up pretty well. I am the quiet guy in the corner
but I am not just being quiet, I am taking everything in and analyising things to help solve the problem

Learning Style Test: Auditory - This has always been a way of me learning. Using visual and audio based learning is how I learned to build my webpage from sources like Youtube. To learn how to use github, I used more of hands on method.
<!-- I edited Damian's text here to make it read better, and to break up the one really long sentence -->

Online IQ Test: I googled the value of my score to see what scale I was at. It turns out I have superior intelligence. Although that's what is stated, I don't feel I am more superior than others and I always like other people's views.
<!-- 6.4.19 I edited Damian's text here to make it read better. I broke the long sentence into smaller pieces, and added some missing punctuation -->

<!-- Damian's profile currently just says "Defender". We will need the result from the human metrics test-->
<!-- 6.4.19 I have posted on the Task One Outstanding Actions forum that Damian's format is different from everybody else's.-->
<!-- Do we need to put the results from the other tests here too as per "Team Profile" of assignment guide-->

Test Result Comments:

From my 3 test outcomes, the way I can contribute to the group is I am more of a visual and hands on learner. I see myself not as a leader, but more of a follower. That doesn't mean I let others do all the work though. I am more of a researcher that finds information from various sources. I think I am beneficial to this group for my ability to source information for us to look over and to collaborate it with everyone else's work and ideas.
<!-- I Edited the above quite a bit. There was a sentence that made no sense to me, so I removed it. I also made a few grammatical changes and added punctuation where required -->
  
Ideal Job: 

I am not sure which direction I am heading in IT yet, but I think I am looking towards IT consultant/network engineering and maybe some software developement. I have also considered working at an IT helpdesk. Within our group our ideal jobs are varied from software developement to networking, but as a whole we require the same sort of skill sets and knowledge as they all interact with eachother. As a software developer you need to know the basics of how technology works and how to utilise it in your developement. An IT consultant is more of an all rounder. When someone has a problem the IT consultant needs to be able to quickly work out if it's a hardware, software or networking issue then contact the relevant department to help resolve the problem as quickly as possible. I couldn't find any rating on IT consultant so I researched networking and what I found was Network and Computer Systems Administrator ranked 19/199 from the careercast website: https://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2017-jobs-rated-report

Ideal Job: 
My ideal job is Server Administrator, or admin that has the overall control of a server. This is usually in the context of a business organisation, where a server administrator oversees the performance and condition of multiple servers in the business organisation.
<!-- 6.4.19 Minor punctuation edits here -->

On the website https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/stem/ I did an investigation and saw that my ideal job is in the 4th position with the following data:
	Network / Systems Admin 32,682 62% 38%)

I see the 1st position is taken by Computer Support specialist with the following data:
	(Computer Support Specialist 121,426 34% 66%) 
	
These research findings have got me thinking, because before that I dedicated myself to my job when I worked for the Government of El Salvador.

Personality Test Results:

Myers-Briggs Test: Logistician (ISTJ-a)

Online Learning Style Test: Auditory: 35% Visual: 40% Tactile: 25% You are a Visual learner!

Big Five Personality Test: You prefer traditional and familiar experiences. You are neither organised or disorganised. 
			   You tend to shy away from social situations. You find it easy to express irritation with others. 
			You aren't particularly nervous, nor calm. 
               
Test Outcomes and my understanding of how it may help the group:

I think based on my ability to be calm and think things through, I can help the group by completing the tasks assigned to me methodically and carefully. I can also suggest to the group the easiest way to complete tasks so as to keep thing moving efficiently and even help with organising tasks.
<!-- 6.4.19 I added a comma and removed the word "in" before methodically -->

"Vision message" <!-- Not sure if each member wants to do this themselves, or if we will use something from their persoanl profile-->

Ideal Job: 
My ideal job in assessment 1 was the Full Stack JavaScript Developer but for this assessment I chose Network Engineer. 		   The job type ranks no.7 in the Burning Glass comparison chart with regard to job availability. The other group member's ideal jobs require different technical abilities, like programming for example. That particular skill isn't required to be a network engineer. All IT jobs have specialised aspects that are similar to other IT jobs, but I think the real similarities between IT jobs are the personal skills. Personal skills like effective communication and analytical thinking are important skills for any IT job or any job for that matter. 
<!-- 6.4.19 Minor punctuation edits and minor sentence restructuring -->

My ideal job would be somewhat different from the other chosen professions. I think the jobs we have chosen have some overlap in the sense that if we were to work in an organisation, each job has the potential to have some kind of dealings with the other.
