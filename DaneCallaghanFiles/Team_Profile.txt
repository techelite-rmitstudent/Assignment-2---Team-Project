<h2>GROUP STRENGTH</h2>
<p>
The results of the personality tests are important as they show how people interact, learn and behave. Having this information helps the team understand each other better. This can be useful when discussing or presenting new ideas, assigning tasks and making sure everyone understands their role.
<!-- I think this section should be done as a group, maybe we can all write a quick summary of how we interpret the personality test results and collectively vote on what to put here -->
