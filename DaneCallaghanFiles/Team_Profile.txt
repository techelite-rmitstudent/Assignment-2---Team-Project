My Ideal Job: Software Engineer - because it has the highest rate for job posting available today and the highest pay rate job in this industry. 
			  It may also lead me to be part of the team who are changing the world into a better place (Innovation Technology). 
			  Comments: Seems the group members have a different type of ideal jobs in each department of Information Technology that when you to put them all together it becomes the strong team of IT which may have knowledge in all aspect of a company who can build software and technology. 
			  "TechElite" is really fit as the name for this group.

<h1>Dane Callaghan</h1>

<a href="https://danecallaghan.github.io/DaneCallaghan/">GitHub Profile</a>

Personality Type: (I-S-T-J) - The Duty Fulfiller
				  Serious and quiet, interested in security and peaceful living. Extremely thorough responsible and dependable.
				  Well developed powers of concentration. Usually interested in supporting and promoting traditions and establishments.
				  Well organised and hardworking, they work steadily towards identified goals.
				
Learning Style:	  Auditory  30%, Visual 40%, Tactile 30% - You are a visual learner.

Big 5 Personality Test: Openness to experience -65
						            Conscientiousness - 96
						            Extroversion - 83
						            Agreeableness - 16
						            Natural reactions - 22
						
How These Results May Influence My Behaviour In A Team:I think I would work well in a team, and would expect we had a solid plan     where everyone knew exactly what is expected from them. 
													   I would want a clear timeline established, with defined tasks set out to be completed in that time. 
													   I have sometimes been described as "too picky" as I can scrutinise every detail. The positive side                 to that is that I am very thorough if assigned a research task.

Things to consider when I form a team: I think personality cetainly plays a part in forming a team, and that it can be beneficial to have a mix of diffeent types. It is important to know everyone's skills, learning methods and how they work best. 
									   If we can understand the various types of personalities, we can understand how best to interact with each type.

Ideal Job:  I have recently moved into the financial planning industry. 
			Currently my ideal job is to be a financial adviser, with the hope of one day moving into a management or mentor type role.
			A Senior Financial Adviser works with clients to help them understand their financial needs. 
			They discuss and assesss various aspects of the client's financial situation such as budgets and cash flow,          superannuation, investments, risk management, estate planning and retirement goals. 
			The adviser will help educate the client on these topics and address any concerns they may have.


			Apart from the position of Senior Financial Planner, the jobs listed above have similar requirements as shown below:

		   - Common Education: All jobs require a degree, and share the Bachelor of IT as a common requirement. Other specialty courses are applicable to each job too, such as extra certification.

           - Common Skills: Communication, Programming, Analytical, Knowlegde of IT systems

		   - Salary: The all have similar ranges of salary that will vary depending on experience and role within that discipline.

	       - Differences: The obvious outlayer is Financial Planning as it's a completely different industry. 
						  Each of the other jobs will require specialist knowledge that will be unique to that position. 
						  A Network Engineer is likely to have a deeper understanding of network structure compared to a software engineer who will specialise in building software. 
						  The IT consultant will have a broad but limited overall knowledge of both.

<h1>Damian Gaffey</h1>

<a href="https://damian-gaffey.github.io/Myprofile/">GitHub Profile</a>

Personality Test Results:

Personality Type: Defender - For me personally I think this sums me up pretty well I am the quiet guy in the corner
but I am not just being quiet I am taking everything in analyising things to help solve the problem

Learning Style Test: Auditory - This has always been a way of me learning with visual and audio it's how I learnt
to build this webpage by using youtube and to learn how to use github I am more of hands on.

Online IQ Test: I googled the value to see what scale I was at and it turns out I have superior intelligence
although that's what is stated I don't feel I have am more superior than others I always like other peoples views

( )<!-- Damian's profile currently just says "Defender". We will need the result from the human metrics test-->
<!-- Do we need to put the results from the other tests here too as per "Team Profile" of assignment guide-->

Test Result Comments:For my 3 test outcomes the way I can contribute to the group is I am more of a visual and hands on learner   by this I achieve things by doing this the way I see myself is not as a leader but more of a follower but that doesn't mean I let other's do the work I am more of a researcher finding information from various sources, I think I am beneficial to this group for my ability to     source information for us to overlook it and collaborate it with everyone else's work and ideas.
  
Ideal Job: My Ideal job in IT is well I am not sure which direction I am heading yet but I think I am looking towards IT consultant/network engineering and maybe some software developement also possibly IT helpdesk. Within our group our ideal jobs a varied from software developement to networking but as a whole we do require the same sort of skill sets and knowledge as they all interact with eachother as a software developer you need to know the basics of how technology works and how to utilise it in your developement, An IT consultant is more of an all rounder when someone has a problem you need to be able to quickly work out if it's a hardware issue or if it is software or networking issue then contact the relevant department to help resolve the issue as quickly as possible. I couldn't find any rating on IT consultant so I researched networking and what I found was Network and computer systems administrator ranked 19/199 from careercast: https://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2017-jobs-rated-report

Ideal Job: My Ideal Job is: Server Administrator, or admin; has the overall control of a server. This is usually in the context of a business organization, where a server administrator oversees the performance and condition of
multiple servers in the business organization.

In the site https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/stem/ I did an investigation and saw that my ideal job in the 4th position, with the following data( Network / Systems Admin 32,682 62% 38%) but I see the first position occupies it (Computer Support Specialist 121,426 34% 66%) what has left me thinking
because before that I dedicated myself when I worked for the Government of El Salvador.

<h1>Rav</h1>

<!-- UPDATE 31.3.19 Rav provided the link to his profile and I added it above -->

Personality Test Results:
Myers-Briggs Test: Logistician (ISTJ-a)
Online Learning Style Test:   Auditory: 35% Visual: 40% Tactile: 25% You are a Visual learner!
Big Five Personality Test: You prefer traditional and familiar experiences. You are neither organised or disorganised. 
						   You tend to shy away from social situations. You find it easy to express irritation with others. 
						   You aren't particularly nervous, nor calm. 
               
Test Outcomes and my understanding of how it may help the group:
I think based on my ability to be calm and think things through I can help the group by completing the tasks assigned to me in methodically and carefully. I can also suggest to the group the easiest way to complete tasks so as to keep thing moving efficiently and even help with organising tasks.

Ideal Job: My ideal job in assessment 1 was the Full Stack JavaScript Developer but for this assessment I chose Network Engineer. 
		   The job types rank no.7 in the burning glass comparison chart with regard to job availability. 
		   The other group members ideal jobs require different technical abilities, like programming, for example, isn't required to be a network engineer. 
		   All IT jobs have specialised aspects that are similar to other IT jobs but I think the real similarities between IT jobs are the personal skills. 
		   Personal skills like effective communication and analytical thinking are important skills for any IT job or any job for that matter. 
		   My ideal job would be somewhat different from the other chosen professions. 
		   I think the jobs we have chosen have some overlap in the sense that if we were to work in an organisation, each job has the potential to have some kind of dealings with the other.

<h2>GROUP STRENGTH</h2>
<p>
The results of the personality tests are important as they show how people interact, learn and behave. Having this information helps the team understand each other better. 
This can be useful when discussing or presenting new ideas, assigning tasks and making sure everyone understands their role.
<!-- I think this section should be done as a group, maybe we can all write a quick summary of how we interpret the personality test results and collectively vote on what to put here -->
