<h1>My documentation of the group's and my own contribution</h1>
<p>
Make notes here about the Canvas forum interactions and tasks I have specifically completed.
Things like uploading files to Canvas, linking my repo, creating folder for work in my branch of group repo.

Be sure to acknowledge the work that each member of the group has done, and comment on that.

Complete this in a timeline like manner to reflect on how the GitHub audit trails documents our work.

30.03.19 - Had a Zoom meeting, there may have been a miscommunication as only Rav and myself attended. We discussed 
how we were finding the assignment, what we thought about the requirements and how to apporach different sections.

We agreed that we need to clarify with Anthony what the exact requirements of the PDF report and the website are. 
We compared what we thought was required for a few sections such as the ideal jobs, tools and the process for group work on GitHub.
