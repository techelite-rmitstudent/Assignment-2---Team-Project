<!-- I have created this file to document my brainstorming ideas for Task 5 - Project Idea -->

Will it include measures to make sure that the app itself can't be hacked, or how will it prevent scammers from recreating a "green light".
E.g scammers create a hack to let the email slip through and green light the email. People then mistakenly trust that its ok.

What technology will be inplace to prevent this?

What skills will we need to ensure we get that right?

In regards to testing the project, how would we do that? Would we use our own develpoed skils to try and see if we can beat it?

Would we contract an external specialist such as Acumenis (BNE based pentration testing company) to test it for us?

What is the reason to make it not for profit? I think it has the potential to generate significant revenue if sold as a package to big business.
I realise the intent is to help people too, but no reason we can't make money if we put a heap of work into it.

Will it be usable on any device? What plans do you have to achieve this?

Will different devices require different skilsets to implement? WHat are these?
