<!-- I have created this file to document my brainstorming ideas for Task 5 - Project Idea -->

Will it include measures to make sure that the app itself can't be hacked, or how will it prevent scammers from recreating a "green light".
E.g scammers create a hack to let the email slip through and green light the email. people then mistakenly trust that its ok.

Will it be usable on any device? What plans do you have to achieve this?
