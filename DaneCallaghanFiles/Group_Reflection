<!-- I have created this file to complete the Group Reflection requirement of the assignment-->

Towards the end of the assignment period, you should reflect as a group on how well you think you have performed in this assignment. 
You should include whatever evidence you may have about the groups processes (such as commit trails from GitHub, 
or project meeting minutes). Each member of the group should contribute up to 200 words about their own perception of the group, 
and the group as a whole should contribute around 400 words. This should include the following attributes.

•	What went well
•	What could be improved
•	At least one thing that was surprising
•	At least one thing that you have learned about groups
•	Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.
