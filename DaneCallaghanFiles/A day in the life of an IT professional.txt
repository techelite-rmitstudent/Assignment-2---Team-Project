<h1> Web Source One</h1>

Software Engineer:

•	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
	
	Software Engineers use their extensive knowledge of programming languages, engineering principles and IT systems to produce software products that
	can be used for applications such as interactive games, web pages, robotics, network controls, mobile devices and basically anywhere you would find software. 
	It is their job to liaise with businesses or people to discuss their needs, then provide a software solution to meet those needs.
	A Software Engineer needs to address the entire software development lifecycle - to analyse the needs, and then design, test and develop software in order to meet those needs.
	The following list of duties and responsibilities was taken from the website: https://www.roberthalf.com.au/our-services/it-technology/software-engineer-jobs
	
	•	Improving system quality by identifying issues and common patterns, and developing standard operating procedures
    •	Enhancing applications by identifying opportunities for improvement, making recommendations and designing and implementing systems
    •	Maintaining and improving existing codebases and peer review code changes
    •	Liaising with colleagues to implement technical designs
    •	Investigating and using new technologies where relevant
    •	Providing written knowledge transfer material

•	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?

	This can depend on the type of Software Engineer (SE) they are. Application SE's are more client facing, as it is their job to design and implement
	software for the client, or the clients customers to interact with.
	They will also interact with other IT professionals as well as Project Managers, Analysts, Marketing Staff and Test Engineers to ensure
	the product is delivered as desired and on time.
	
•	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?
	
	According to https://readwrite.com/2013/04/25/how-software-developers-really-spend-their-time/ Software Engineers spend their time as shown in the
	image below:

•	What aspect of their position is most challenging?

	On the website https://halistechnology.com/2015/04/30/the-hardest-part-of-software-development/ it is suggested perhaps the most challenging part
	being a Software Engineer is communication. They describe the challenges faced when people have different ideas, or that people may have
	a different understanding of what the actual requirements are.
