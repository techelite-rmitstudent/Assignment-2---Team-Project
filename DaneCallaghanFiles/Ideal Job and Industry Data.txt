Job Comparison

Apart from the position of Senior Financial Planner, the jobs listed above have similar requirements as shown below:

- Common Education: All jobs require a degree, and share the Bachelor of IT as a common requirement. Other specialty courses are applicable to each job too, such as extra certification.

- Common Skills: Communication, Programming, Analytical, Knowlegde of IT systems

- Salary: The all have similar ranges of salary that will vary depending on experience and role within that discipline.

- Differences: The obvious outlayer is Financial Planning as it's a completely different industry. Each of the other jobs will require specialist knowledge that will be unique to that position. A Network Engineer is likely to have a deeper understanding of network structure compared to a software engineer who will specialise in building software. The IT consultant will have a broad but limited overall knowledge of both.

Whilst the group's career plans share some similarities, there are distinct differences that separate the long term pathways.
