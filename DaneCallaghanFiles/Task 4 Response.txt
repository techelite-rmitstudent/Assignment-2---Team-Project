Hi Everyone,

Jon - thanks again for being so organised and getting these task discussions set up. I appreciate all the work you're putting in to making sure everyone is organised!

My response is:

Name: Dane Callaghan

I'd like to nominate Damian as well. I'm voting for Damian, as currently 3 other members (including myself) have already been allocated as overseers on other tasks and we haven't really heard much from the other two members yet. Due to the timeline and due date, I have to put my trust in active people. After talking to Damian in the zoom meeting on Sunday, I also believe he will do a great job!

I'm voting for option 2. This was discussed in the group meeting on Saturday and Sunday, and Rav echoed Jon's opinion above in regards to not having enough time to actually interview someone. I completely agree that it makes more sense for each person to review a couple of youtube videos each and contribute their report to a group folder on the repo.

(As a side note, I've made a separate discussion post about actually getting our files onto the master. I think a couple of us aren't sure on what's happening with that).

The topics I'm voting for are - Cyber Security, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Autonomous Vehicles and Robots.

Thanks guys,

Dane.
