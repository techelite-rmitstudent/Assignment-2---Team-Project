Hi Guys,

Firstly, thank you to Jon for taking the leadership role and helping to get us all organised! I think you're doing a great job with that.

Please see below for my response in regards to our task.

 

Group 4 - Dane Callaghan - I'm happy to be nominated to oversee the organisation of this data. I'll just need clarification of how we want to do it. My assumption is that once we have everyone's data, we will collate it on our repository and address the requirements of the assignment sheet? Let me know :)

        My Ideal Job: Senior Financial Adviser (info on my GitHub page)
        Assignment Repository: Suggested Repository ( GitHub ).

 

I have uploaded a clone of my GitHub Profile to the files section of our group page. I wasn't 100% sure of how to do this though. I followed a guide, cloned it to my desktop, then copy/pasted all of the contents into a new folder. Let me know if if there's any issue there.

This is the link to my GitHub page https://danecallaghan.github.io/DaneCallaghan/ (Links to an external site.)

As a side note, I usually do a bit of work most mornings around 3-4am as I work full time. I check the group page everyday, but it may take until the weekend before I have time to do a lot of the work. Happy to fit time in where I can through the week too.
