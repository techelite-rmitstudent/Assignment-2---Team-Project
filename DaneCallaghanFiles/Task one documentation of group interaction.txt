<h1> Dane's Comments<
Jon created a discussion thread in our Canvas group for Task 1 and suggested a format to follow to collect each members 
info for the task. This allowed all members of the group to contribute their suggestions for the group name, tools and tests to use, along
with the link to their GitHub profile and personal information. Each member contributed to this discussion by providing all
of the required information and upadating the work status once complete. Aaron didn't make contact, but we are all hopefully he
does soon. Various members suggested methods of how to complete certain tasks, and provided guidance to members that needed it.
Overall there was reall great participation from everyone except Aaron.
