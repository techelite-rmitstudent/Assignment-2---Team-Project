                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7"><em>Reported by: Dane</em><br><br>On the website Techtarget.com they define cyber security as 
<br>“Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks.”
<br><br>To better understand exactly what cyber security can do, we must first understand the types of threats that cyber security will help to protect against.
<br><br>Below is a brief list of the types of threats commonly seen in the cyber security world:
<br><br>•	Ransomware – Like the name suggests, it’s a file or program the can restrict or disable a user’s access to their computer. The attacker then demands a payment to give the user back their access.
<br><br>•	Malware – Any file or program that is intended to cause harm or damage to a computer’s system or files. These include viruses, spyware, trojans and woms.
<br><br>•	Social Engineering – This attack comes from users being made to feel like what they’re seeing is real, then interacting with a file or program that can give the attackers sensitive information such as bank details, passwords and in some cases complete access to their computers network.
<br><br>•	Phishing – Similar to above, the attack may come in the form of something like an email which encourages the user to provide sensitive information that otherwise wouldn’t have been given. &nbsp;<br><br>Why is cyber security important?
<br><br>With consideration to the above-mentioned threats, it becomes clear that people and business should employ technology that protects them from such attacks.
<br> 
<br>
<br>What can be done now?
<br><br>On the website https://cybersafesolutions.com/services/ they offer a list of services that can be used to facilitate cyber security. Some of these services include:
<br><br>•	Managed Detection Response and Containment – Networks are constantly monitored to detect any abnormal activity. If a threat is detected, it can be contained and responded to in real time.
<br><br>•	Network Security Monitoring – Threats are identified, assets can be tracked and regularly scanned for any vulnerabilities. Behavioural analytics can be performed to further identify potential threats.
<br><br>•	Endpoint Security Monitoring – Endpoint intrusions (unauthorised access) can be instantly identified and isolated to prevent theft of data and sensitive information.
<br><br>•	Security Awareness Training &amp; Simulated Phishing Tests  - Staff and individuals can be trained to recognise potential threats and react accordingly. <br>
<br>•	Penetration Testing – This is used to detect system vulnerabilities by performing simulated attacks on a network or system. Once the weak spots are identified, corrective measures can then be implemented.
<br><br>•	Threat Hunting – Compromise Assessment – A proactive approach is taken to seek out and destroy threats, or to ensure that endpoints or assets are ready for the attacks when they occur.
<br><br>•	Security Policy Development – Organisation can undertake the development of a cyber security policy that can include regular testing, upgrades and evaluation of the protection system.
<br><br>Individuals and organisations have a vast array of cyber security products to choose from that vary in application and cost. When implemented, these products provide protection against the types of threats mentioned previously. <br><br>Technological developments from the makers of the products mentioned below make advanced protection possible.
<br>Some of these products include:
<br><br>•	Checkpoint CloudGaurd – Protects against cyber attacks on cloud infrastructure workloads.
<br><br>•	CrowdStrike Falcon X – This automates threat analysis, and can provide intelligence and automation to organisations data security centres. It immediately shares threat data to other tools like firewalls and gateways.
<br><br>•	Forcepoint Dynamic Data Protection – This product continually uses behavioural analytics to determine any out of the ordinary use of assets or data and then automatically provided appropriate security countermeasures.
<br><br>•	Okta ThreatInight – This product learns user’s behaviour over time and can allow users to log in password free in a “normal” setting. If the same user attempts to log in from an “unusual” setting, the product will ask a security question, and a second factor before granting access.&nbsp;<br></p>

People are becoming increasingly aware of the consequence of cyber attacks, and a result more people are looking to the market to but cyber security products.<br> On the website https://www.csoonline.com/article/2946017/worldwide-cybersecurity-market-sizing-and-projections.html they predict that the market will continue to grow to a potential 170bn sizing due to the increased interest and demand. What does this mean? It means cyber security businesses will continue to advance research in the industry and provide consistent solutions to the ever growing threat of cyber crime.
<br><br>What is likely to change?<br>
<br>As cyber security technology develops and progresses, particularly in the AI and automation areas, humans are likely to become increasingly redundant. IT professionals who specialise in the monitoring of network and system security may eventually be replaced by AI. Businesses will move towards an AI system that can learn human behaviour, work non stop, analyse high volumes of data and provide instant security solutions that humans simply can’t compete with.
<br>The positive of that is that the demand for creators of this technology will increase and the level of AI will advance not only cyber security, but all technologies where machine learning exists.

We only have to look around as we walk down a city street to see a plethora of people with their heads buried in their phones. We see interaction with automated banking systems, shopping systems, transport systems and information systems. <br><br>On the website https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/ they report that there are currently 2.32 billion facebook users. 2.32 billion……. That’s 2.32 billion people using some sort of device to access information in a cyber setting. That means there are 2.32 billion opportunities for people to attack someone’s information.
<br><br>The advancement in cyber security will allow for the peace of mind to use these technologies without the fear of being susceptible to an attack. With the increase in market size, it follows that cost should fall as businesses have to compete with flooded market competition.
<br><br>I don’t believe anything will actually be that different in my daily life. Not yet anyway. It’s possible and likely that identification protocols such as retina and facial recognition will become the norm for everyday use of technology.&nbsp;<br></p>
