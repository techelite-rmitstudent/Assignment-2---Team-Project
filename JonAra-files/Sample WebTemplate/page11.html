<br>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. <br>
<br><strong>•	What is the state of the art of this new technology?</strong><br> 
<br>Ref. Article 1: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017637418 <br>
<br>The origin and the history of robotics are introduced, and the present status of robot progress, its significance and a new role of robot in human society are discussed. Nationwide research activities are reviewed and some of the research and development results are reported. The population of robot is rapidly increasing in advanced countries and the social impact of robot’s diffusion must be carefully inspected. Finally, how to meet with a coming robot era from the standpoint of human society is considered.
<br><br>Ref. Article 2: <br>https://www.aivoke.com/news/state-of-the-art-robotics/ 
<br>The current state of research seems to be only a few steps away from it if you have a closer look at state of the art robotics. Many people connect the topic Artificial Intelligence mostly with robotics. This is very superficial because robotics is only one part of the big puzzle that is AI research. You could call it the “give AI a shell” part. Furthermore, some AI personalities take the view that embodiment is one fundamental factor for Artificial Intelligence. Independent from that view there is a lot of research and development concerning robotics.
<br>
<br>•	<strong>What can be done now? </strong><br>
<br>Ref. Article 3: https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/technology/robotics/seven-human-things-that-robots-can-already-do/
<br><br>THINGS THAT ROBOTS CAN ALREADY DO
<br><br>My Investigation:
<br>There are different types of robot doing different type of work mainly having human interaction but others work replacing human activity. There are Robot duties like sorting packages and deliver them in front of your door like Spot, its dog shape allows it to also go up and down stairs. Also, there is some robots that helps human on their house chores a robotic butler like Roomba, the ‘intelligent’ vacuum cleaner that detects, thanks to its sensors, the areas for cleaning. After that, robotic lawnmowers appeared, with daily schedules and programmable zones, then barbecue-grill cleaning robots, an invention designed for this typically American hobby. More devices have also emerged for cleaning tables and windows. Even some robots that works for health, education, and recreation. The article mentions about the Da Vinci a robotic system which became the arms and eyes of the real physician. It allowed him to perform complicated operations at a distance and to have specialized surgeons who were located thousands of kilometres from the hospital where the patient was. Other robots have soft and caring character which helping people in needs like Robocoach, a full-sized robot with a big smiley face mainly use for elderly. However, for childcare facilities they uses Zenbo the storytelling robot, and for mini educational with kid interaction robot Kibo is keeping kids learning with fun. The most interesting and revolutionary robots are Auto Self Driving Cars the vehivle that are able to make autonomous decisions after analysing millions of data collected with cameras and sensors.
<br><br><strong>•	What is likely to be able to do be done soon? (say in the next 3 years).
</strong><br><br>Ref. Article 4: https://www.theguardian.com/zurichfuturology/story/0,,1920335,00.html<br>
<br>“A mind and a hand where it's needed while you sit safely at home and run the show. It's a future goal”
<br>-- Mark W. Tilden, <em>robot physicist </em><br>
<br>My Comments: 
<br>	There are more Robots that we are yet to see and yet are for replacing human activity to machine. This is not bad at all in terms if we say what it makes the better way. The future technology for Robots are intend to be involved with human interaction rather machine that works on its own just like a standalone machine that we see today. <br>
<br>Ref Article 5:<br>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/humanoid-robot-market-to-double-by-2023-industrial-robotics-to-hit-72b/
<br><br>The article mentions that by 2023, we will see an increasing use of humanoid robots for education, as well as in the retail industry, to better personalize customer support. The medical and logistics sectors are also interested in integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) via robots, as do industries that run autonomous rescue operations, according to the report.
<br>-- Alison DeNisco Rayome,<em> Senior Editor for TechRepublic
</em><br><br>My Comments:
<br>Future machine will be like Robots that can identify its own character with the ability to build a character to produce fast and better outcome, a thinking machine uses Machine Learning as an Artificial Intelligent. We already have Humanoid version of robots that available in public, however, there are some more fascinating Robots that will be available soon to experience. &nbsp;<br></p>

<br><br>“Once the humanoid robot became a commodity item, robots began to move in and replace humans in the workplace in a significant way.” 
<br>-- Marshall Brain,<em> writer
</em><br><br>My Comments:
<br>	Robotics technology can have great impact to all of us specially to those people who works in the field involving technologies like; workers in manufacture facilities, airline services and many others. Robotics technology could potentially dominate hands on works more than human and eventually replacing humans in the workplace then robots will serve as more talented than humans. 
<br>
<br>	In the article it mentions that “Robots in the workplace will be a very popular idea because they will eliminate labour costs. Pilots will be the first to go because pilots are incredibly expensive and their jobs are largely automated already.” It seems really frightening that no more jobs left for humans in terms of the economy is falling down, but the article also mention that “Conventional wisdom says that the economy will respond to all of these unemployed workers by creating new jobs for them.” This means that the technology will help the economy to stabilize itself but the article inclines to produce the idea that the increasing of un-employed workers is because of this robotic technology. At glance we can see workers rate of employments are going down which what is happening today but not because of this technology as the matter of fact this technology that available to us benefited many by producing product more than enough that the normal person can able to produce in short period of time. We just not reducing the cost of the outcome products and remains with high price tags. So, this only means that today just big companies taking advantage of technology against human capacity. As for future analogy of this robotics technology we can see that we are actually buying our time to extend our life. If the Robot can produce product outcome without human sacrifice then it is a life saver. Money can become so powerful element to control human as today but, in the future, it will be just a paper as no value it may seems. Workers who works with Artificial Intelligence will be smarter than ever.
<br>
<br>	Robotics technology may change the future into a better place or make it worse. The article stated that “our society, as it is structured today, works like this -- you must either own a profitable business, or work for someone who owns a business, in order to "make a living." You have no choice. You must earn money in order to live your life. If you do not work and earn money, you are homeless. “, in this statement shows just how poor the employment structure that we have today. So, as to go for future progress to make our future a better place we must change this structure into smarter way against the statement of “You must earn money in order to live your life.” Most business company now a day change this money thinking into workplace family attachment with loyalty balance mindset. Robots can be one of the way to get the changes we need. If the Robots can produce products with minimal cost then more is plenty than empty. Shortages will be unknown as everything can be provided and plenty of people will afford it. &nbsp;<br></p>

<br><br>	Robotics Technology can be viewed differently today as Humanoid or Machine. As of today, Machine is the most dominantly known to assist human in doing their task and for producing high quality product with consistency. Humanoid technology is yet to become common and be used in the workplace but we could see that it could be beneficial to human race if human interaction to the robots are minimal. <br>
<br>Robot should always be designed into a unified method and not just to be general use for everything. If ever the Robotics Technology reach the same level of iRobot that has Artificial Intelligence such Humanoid Robo become like a human then there might be to concern or become a relief to us. However, a companion with a loving and caring Robot in your household is not a bad idea at all. When an elderly needs a personal assistance like nurse such a loving smart Robot can really be helpful in anyway, or a Robot teacher that will able to teach kids or even adults with precise knowledge is really beneficial for our advancement as for our advantage. <br><br>Just to think of how much we spend in some unnecessary things and we do forget the most important things in life, and if then Robots can be able to do the unnecessary things for you, so as you can concentrate for the most important things in your life. Life balance will be then just as common to everyone, stress level is reduced as seems none at all. Life runs as it seems a flow of cloud instead a flow like a river. <br>
<br>The dream came into reality with work balance is undoubtedly. Robot is not just seemingly like a toy rather it is a companion that makes things better for you. Self-Driving cars is the example is one of the innovation of technology in the field of Robotics which when reached the full potential and maturity of the technology it will really benefits human improving our transportation into secure and life saving device. Travelling can just become a door to enter into new room.&nbsp;<br></p>
