My Comments:
- the link to group website: I have created my file folder in the repository for project item for building the group website 
that I created so that the group Overseers can then have easy access and transfer my work to the main project folder. 
(Note: Changes in the main project is the most crucial situation in building a software or a website with group of people. 
Only overseers of the task should update or do some changes in the main project object. This will minimize debug error, 
and group members will communicate in organised manner.)

- the link to your group's Git repository (GitHub): I have installed my GitHub Desktop to help me organised my Git Repository 
Group links and also for other easy option in commit and push my work to my folder in repository I been using the GitHub Bush CMD pane.

- how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects the group's work?: 
I have not seen it yet but I trust that all members do their best to give work 
efforts to complete the group assignments.
