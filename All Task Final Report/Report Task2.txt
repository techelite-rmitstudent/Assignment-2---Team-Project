Task 2 Overseer
"Jonathan Aragones"

Comments: 
"I have created the GitHub Group Organization using the guide from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUu6cmcC-3A. 
We used Canvas Discussion Article – Task2 asking the group members to give their GitHub username to send 
an invitation and be part of the Group GitHub organization account. We suggest each group member should have 
their workspace folder in the Repository. Changes in the main project is the most crucial situation in building a 
software or a website with group of people.Only overseers of the task should update or do some changes in the main 
project object. This will minimize debug error, and group members will communicate in organised manner. We ask the 
group to install and be familiar in GitHub Desktop and GitHub CMD pane so when publishing their work into their 
workspace folder in the respository will be easy for them. I have made every member to be the owner of the repositor
so that they can access the folder freely. The members are aware of how important not to edit someones workspace so 
and to be organised on their workspace. The team did really well on this area."
