I created a task for everyone to provide their comments on the group work we did.

Here is everyone's reponses:

Rav's Comments:
What went well
We were all focused on the assessment so everyone was contributing equally to all parts of the project as we went along. None of us were shy in asking and commenting on what needed to be complete for each part of the project. One of your members, Jon, took it upon himself to lead the group and divided each part of the assessment into Tasks and appointed Overseers through a vote. It not only helped us get started but also started a conversation on what we needed to do.

What could be improved 
We relied on using Canvas to organise all the information in the group for the tasks that we needed to complete for the assessment. The way it’s set up however is difficult to follow and it’s hard to see who is commenting on something without having to scroll though a lot of messages. I think we could have used an external group conversation tool that would allow easier organisation for conversations around tasks.

At least one thing that was surprising
The fact that, despite our time differences, we were able to communicate effectively and move on through the project to reach our reach our goal of completing the assessment. Without the tools available to us through today’s technology this would not be possible.

At least one thing that you have learned about groups
I think working in a group can sometimes be challenging as usually there is a quite a big task that needs to be completed with everyone’s collective assistance. Effective communication, therefore, is an important factor when it comes to working in a group setting; whether that is getting everyone to focus on the task at hand or asking for help with a certain part of the project.
