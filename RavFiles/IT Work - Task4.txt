Network Engineer

What kind of work is done by the IT professional? 

This IT professional is a network engineer. His main role in the company is to design, implement and maintain the computer networks within a company. As opposed to network administrators that handle more day to day support of the network, a network engineer focuses on high level design and planning. By selecting the correct technologies and making sure they are implemented correctly, network engineers ensure a high performing network for all its users.

What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?

Network engineers, according to the article, would speak with department heads or certain members of staff to accomodate any of their networking requirements. In the instance of the article, it is a training on how to do a particular task on a network. They also delegate tasks to  people in your team, i.e network technicians. Again, in this cases a part of the training was delegated towards a network technician.

Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?

Depending on where they work, it can range from within an office or within a server farm. Either way, they would generally be sitting down at a desk for most of their day. If there is some kind of malfunction with the server, you might have to visit the physical server itself to make sure it gets fixed. Depending on where you work it might be some distance away, especially if your company employs off-site data centres. 

What aspect of their position is the most challenging?

I would say having to maintain such a large network would be the most challenging, as not only do you need to fix issues that arise occasionally during your work hours, but you might have to stay late to resolve more complicated issues.
