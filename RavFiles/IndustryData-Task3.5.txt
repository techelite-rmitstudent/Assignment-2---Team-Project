Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?

I think it shows that while you don't need a lot of technical skill to do the job, however, you do need a lot of various general skills in the way you think, i.e problem solving, troubleshooting, planning. Of course, there is a level of technical skill that you require in order to perform your job as expected by your employer, but the choice the employer makes on who he chooses to hire, I believe, is weighted more upon their general skills.
