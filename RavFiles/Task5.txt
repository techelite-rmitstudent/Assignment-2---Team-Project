I nominate "Aaron Bowden" to be Overseer of Task 5 - Project Idea.

Reading his profile and also speaking with him in the previous meeting assured my decision on nominating him to be overseer of the task. On top of that, his idea for heavily reducing dangerous emails, including spam, was so well written that we decided to contribute to his project idea for this part of the assessment.

My comments:
Hi Everyone,

I nominate Aaron to be task overseer as well, and I am happy to go with his idea Project Rufus!

Kind Regards,
Rav
