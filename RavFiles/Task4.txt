Task4.txt

Group 4 - Rav:

I nominate "Damian Gaffey" (Myself) to be Overseer of Task 4 - Investigative Case Report. 
Overseer Nominee of this Task: Damian
Speaking with him on the meeting and looking and by looking at the group strength post he provided, I can safely say Damian is the man for the job.


My Comments:
(1) IT Work

I agree with Jon and Dane and I vote for the second option of looking up interviews for the day in the life of I.T Professionals. I've already looked three sources up and added it to a text file(see attached file to this post). I'll be adding the file to my folder under the assignment folder in canvas if you need to find it again.

(2) IT Technology
To get this going as fast as possible I am going to echo what Dane suggested which is: Cyber Security, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Autonomous Vehicles and Robots. Since we all have to write the report on the same thing, the sooner we decide this the better(Jon correct me if I'm wrong about this).
