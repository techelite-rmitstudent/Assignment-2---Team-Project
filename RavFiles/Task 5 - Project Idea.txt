Addition to section - Accessibility:

New section below Accessibility - Encryption: Any data we do collected will be anonymous and only to improve our algorithm in detecting dangerous emails. All information that is sent to our servers through our email plugin will be 256-bit end-to-end encrypted. This means that no one but the computers see's the data coming through to it.
